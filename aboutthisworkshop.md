# 🎉 GitHub Workshop with Marlon Cobos 🚀

I recently attended a **GitHub workshop** led by the amazing Marlon Cobos, and it was 🔥 **incredibly informative and fun**! 😄  
Marlon covered everything from forking repositories 🍴, to managing branches 🌿, and collaborating on projects 👥. It helped me unlock a lot of GitHub skills I wasn’t fully confident with before! 💡

The hands-on approach he used really made things click 🖱️, and I loved learning about resolving merge conflicts 🧩 and pushing updates like a pro. 🏆  
The workshop was well-paced and inclusive of different skill levels, making sure no one was left behind 🐢 or overwhelmed 🚀.

Overall, it was an awesome experience! Now I feel like a **GitHub wizard** 🧙‍♂️✨ thanks to Marlon! 💻⚡
